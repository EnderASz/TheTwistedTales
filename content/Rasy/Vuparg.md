Vupargargans, also known as Vupargs, are native to the Kingdom of Vupar, a demiplane of Yoviran dimension. They once were a subrace of Vuparians, who wanted control over the nature instead of trying to protect it. This allowed them to possess magic that manipulates living essence of creatures through blood. Instead of nature, Vupargs believe in the blessing of the land itself, which they call "Ara, the Mother", that allowed the nature to thrive upon itself so that Vupargs can thrive upon nature.

Vupargs are given one name when they're born, and use a clan's name as their surname. This allows members of different clans to recognize each other more easly. Most clans use the founder's name as the clan's name.
